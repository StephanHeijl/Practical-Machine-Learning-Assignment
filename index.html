			<h2>Exploratory Data visualization using Weka</h2>
			<p>
				The PML training set consists of over a hundred of different variables. Using the open source machine learning program Weka<a href="#cite-1" class="cite">[1]</a>, I was able to quickly visualize the different ranges of data.
			</p>
			
			
			<a name="low-var-data"></a>
			<h2>Low variation data exclusion</h2>
			<p>
				A large array of variables can be shown not contain significant variation in their data. This results in data that is either useless for machine learning, since its presence does not indicate a certain class, or can even lead to overfitting. Using R's <span class="code">NearZeroVar</span> function allowed me to filter these attributes, resulting in a leaner, more relevant dataset. This dataset was quicker to train and less likely to overfit on irrelevant data.
			</p>
			
			<a name="pca"></a>
			<h2>Principal Component Analysis</h2>
			<p>
				The initial data visualization step revealed a number of attributes showed very similar patterns. With principal component analysis we can merge these attributes to a more compact, more bias resistant
